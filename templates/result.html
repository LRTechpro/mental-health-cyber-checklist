    <h1>Checklist Results</h1>
    <p>Your Score: {{ score }} out of {{ total }}</p>
    <p><strong>Cyber Risk Level:</strong> {{ level }}</p>

    <h2>What This Means for Your Organization</h2>
    <p>Your score reflects how prepared your mental health organization is to protect sensitive client data, maintain service continuity, and stay aligned with HIPAA and ethical standards.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>16–18 (Low Risk):</strong> Excellent! You’ve built strong practices around confidentiality, incident response, and operational continuity.</li>
        <li><strong>10–15 (Moderate Risk):</strong> You're on the right path, but there are gaps to address—like formalizing policies or training staff.</li>
        <li><strong>Below 10 (High Risk):</strong> High vulnerability. Consider addressing cybersecurity, business continuity, and HIPAA-readiness together.</li>
    </ul>
